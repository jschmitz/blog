|The best companies cascade goals| The best companies cascade meaning. Work is ahead of you, goals are behind you. Work is specific and detailed; goals are abstract. Work changes fast; goals change slowly or not at all. Work makes you feel like you have agency; goals make you feel like a cog in a machine. Work makes you feel trusted; goals make you fell distrusted. Work is work; goals aren't. |
|The best people are well rounded|Messi uses his left foot in a 10:1 ratio. Focus on strengths; activities that make you feel good / find joy in.|
