## Kanbans three principles of service delivery

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO WATCH FOR:
* WIP limits are raised as needed so the team doesn't hit them anymore.
* Everyone has a large "background task" on their plate to mask times when they'd otherwise be idle.
* Team members sit idle waiting for more work to pull in, rather than swarming on bottlenecks.
* Throwing more person hours at persistent bottlenecks is preferred over improvements in engineering practices or team processes.
