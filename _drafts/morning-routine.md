# Morning Routine

I get up a 5am and I mention this with folks and the first reaction I normally get is gross, why would you do that? I have a pretty good reason, for me, that is the only time of the day, most days, that I can accomplish a few things that I’d like to. When I start accomplishing those things I want to accomplish it feels great and get into a good feedback loop.  So why do I get up at 5am?  Because I enjoy it.

The three most important things I want to do in a day are
1. Spend time with the family
1. Long term productivity for career
1. Exercise

I’ve started getting those three done before 9am hits.

How did I get there?
It took me a substantial amount of time to get to a 5am wake up time. It’s early. I went that direction vs. staying up late because getting in front of a computer late in the night really doesn’t work for me. I have a lot of trouble sleeping afterwards and I the other thing I do is exercise. That doesn’t work great for me late at night… so 5am it is.

I’d like to think that I’ve moved my life into a 5am routine but I’m not so sure. My life may have moved me. For years I’ve been attempting to get to the 5am wake up time

## The Night before
The night before is critical to get into the habit of waking up early. I have arrived at a checklist of prep work make the morning easy and efficient. Most importantly, I get to sleep in the 9:00 hour so I am still getting a solid number of hours of sleep.
Get clothes out for the morning and into office (minimize disruption)
Get the coffee ready
Read physical book or Kindle Paperwhite (sometimes TV, no phones or computers)
Know what I’m going to do (code, write, read)
Plan exercise

I program the coffee pot to automatically and this helps me roll out of bed, its still hard to do, but the coffee being ready and the thought I’d be wasting is helpful for me to get moving!

The kids have, finally, started to sleep consistently through the night. This was not the case until recently and I prioritized sleep over exercise and extra productivity.
The Morning Routine
I set a wrist vibration alarm, a Fitbit, to try and cause as little disrupting as possible getting out of bed. Earlier is better here from a disruption stand point. Later times of even 5:30 or 6:00 result in other folks getting up this defeats the purpose of the early morning and getting time to focus.

I focus on three things important to me.
Building
Exercise
Family Time

## Building - Coding or Writing
I start at the computer. I want to make tangible progress on a project I’m working on. If I’m building software I want to get a commit done or a tiny feature completed. If I’m writing I’d like to get a post done or make something better that has tangible result I can, again, commit into Github.

My Github profile is my indication that I’m getting a few things done. I don’t get a commit in everyday, some days don’t make sense, some days I sleep in or whatever. No big deal, just want to see activity there and a bunch of green days.

## Exercise
Between 6:30 and 7:00 I got to exercise. I started writing a bunch on this and I’ll move that to its own post. I’ll try to get about 30 minutes in and alternate intensity days. One day I’ll find a way to run, do burpees and pull ups. The next day I’ll do yoga, that recently got added and its really helpful for me. Another post.

## Family Time
By 7:30 I’m having breakfast with the fam. I’ll try to get the kids to do something with me and that is hit or miss. I’m working on more activities during this timeframe and less cartoons. Gotta change that habit...

I’ll hang out till about 9:00 and then on weekdays get going for my day “at the office”.

## What am I missing?
I am not watching TV on a regular basis. Its more on occasion. I wouldn’t really say I’m missing it either. We don’t really have it on during the day except for kids shows. If there is a show I want to check out, like the Tiger King (crazy!), I do try and find time to make that happen with a quick episode later in the evening.

## Conclusion
I’m really enjoying this routine and feel productive. The journey to get to this particular routine took years and consistent tweeking and I expect that to continue as circumstances change. This routine took me years and an pandemic to arrive. No commuting also makes this much easier to achieve.
