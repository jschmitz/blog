# Why 5AM? - The Morning Routine

My alarm is set for 5AM six days a week except Sunday. I’ve chosen to do this to myself but why? Why in the world would I do that to myself? For me, that 5am to 7am time-frame is the only time of the day, most days, where the house is quiet and I can make choices about how I spend about two hours of the day consistently. Through the rest of the day, at home and at work, my time is, for the most part, dedicated to those around me or has a likelihood of interruption. The 5am alarm enables me to spend time on a few areas that are important to me on a daily basis.

So why do I get up at 5am?  Because I enjoy it.

## How did I get started?
First, I decided early mornings work better for me; staying up late and getting in front of a computer late in the night really doesn’t work for me. In the software word I know many people that late nights work great for them vs. early mornings. I have a lot of trouble sleeping afterwards and my mind races with screen time andI the other thing I do is exercise. That doesn’t work great for me late at night either and mornings are better. The process of discovery and adjustment took me a substantial amount of time to change my schedule. There were many small adjustments and failed attempts before arriving at a consistent 5am wake up time. It’s early.

So why 5am? It works better for how I’m wired and what I want to do.

## The Night before
The night before is critical to get into the habit of waking up early. I have arrived at a checklist to make the morning easy and efficient. Most importantly, I get to sleep in the 9:00 hour so I am still getting a solid number of hours of sleep.
1. Get clothes out for the morning and into office (minimize disruption)
1. Get the coffee ready
1. Read physical book or Kindle Paperwhite (sometimes TV, no phones or computers)
1. Know what I’m going to do (code, write, read)
1. Plan exercise

The coffee pot is programmed to start at 5:05amI and this helps me roll out of bed too and that rolling about of bed is still a challenge, but the coffee being ready helps to drag out of bed.

An additional parent note, the kids have, finally, started to sleep consistently through the night. This was not the case until recently and my experience has been that moving the alarm earlier while you’re getting inconsistent sleep is not a good combo. I personally found getting sleep was more important for my day than getting more hours in the day during the inconsistent sleep phase.
The Morning Routine
I set a wrist vibration alarm, a Fitbit, to try and cause as little disrupting as possible getting out of bed. Earlier is better here from a disruption stand point. Later times of even 5:30 or 6:00 result in other folks hearking me rustle about and then getting up. This has a couple of bad combination results, my expectations of quiet time not there and others have less sleep.

Why 5am? I don’t wake up others or if I do they go back to sleep.

## What I do
I focus on three things important to me to start the day:
1. Creating
1. Exercise
1. Family Time

On most days, I am getting all three of those accomplished before 9am, so I’ve had a good day already and the rest is gravy.

### Creating - Coding or Writing
I start at the computer. I want to make tangible progress on a project I’m working on. If I’m building software I want to get a commit done or a tiny feature completed. If I’m writing I’d like to get a post done or make something better that has tangible result I can, again, commit into Github.

My Github profile is my indication that I’m getting a few things done. I don’t get a commit in everyday, some days don’t make sense, some days I sleep in or whatever. No big deal, just want to see activity there and a bunch of green days.

### Exercise
Between 6:30 and 7:00 I go to exercise. I started writing a bunch on this and I’ll move that to its own post. I’ll try to get about 30 minutes daily and alternate intensity days with lower intensity stretch days. One day I’ll find a way to run, do burpees and pull ups. The next day I’ll do yoga (yes I started Yoga and it’s great!). I’ll add more in another post.

### Family Time
By 7:30 I’m having breakfast with the fam. I’ll try to get the kids to do something with me and that is hit or miss. I’m working on more activities during this timeframe and less cartoons. We started walks and bike rides and that's great.

I’ll hang out till about 9:00 and then on weekdays get going for my day at the office.

### What did I give up?
Mainly TV. I do watch a few shows occasionally. I wouldn’t really say I’m missing TV either. I’ll find time for a series I really want to watch or catch up on social crazes like the Tiger King (have craze nearby Tiger King seems appropriate). So not zero TV, just not much.

### Closing Thoughts
The process to arrive at what I am currently doing in the morning has taken years of adjusting to my changing environment and constraints to arrive where it is today. My experience has been positive using the early morning schedule for multiple years and this current version seems to be particularly great for me. If you’re looking to get into an early morning routine, make it your own, keep adjusting and figure out what works for you!
