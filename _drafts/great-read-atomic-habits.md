title: 'Habits Drive Outcomes: Atomic Habits'
---

I enjoy being productive. Learning, exercising, doing random things around the house. It drives my wife crazy sometimes but I really enjoy seeing things get done and I enjoy the process.

After having kids the productivity that I enjoyed dwindled. Studying dropped, less exercise, few side projects and tinkering around the house mostly disappeared. The good habits I had were no longer easy. Those habits didn't fit our two kids and two career very busy reality. Gradually those habits went way.

Luckily, I've always been reader and started reading books about habits, influence, productivity how your brain works. I've found those fascinating and I've gradually started to build back the learning, exercising and home projects I find enjoyable. It hasn't been easy with several starts and stops. I've found I have three main challenges to get started again:
# I overdo it at first
# I don't give anything else up
# I don't make it easy (mostly due to the first item in the list)

A recent read, I've found especially helpful has been [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear. It's is all about how to build small habits, small being the keyword for me, to do the things you want. One theme I've seen consistently is that habits and daily practices compound. I believe I've seen this over the years with folks that are good and great at what they do. With that in mind, I believe the results achieve are a reflection of your daily habits.

Atomic Habits was a page turner for me that kept me engaged. The book touched on many of the main themes of habits as well as new thoughts to take away and apply. One of those new thoughts to me was your identity emerges out of your habits. If you want to complete an IronMan you become a triathlete. That is part of your identity. Your habits, that may start small, change your beliefs about yourself and how others view you.

Speaking of starting small, I traditionally over do new things I am trying to start. I start thinking about starting two a days exercising or writing everyday for an hour to get a blog started. A main takeaway for me is to start small and build up. Get a small workout and leave wanting more. Write a blog post every Saturday morning.  Start small and gain momentum.

To do gain that momentum, there are several
* Declare your intention
  * I will [desired behavior] at [time] at [location]
  * I will run at 6am on the trail
* Make it easy, add cues to your environment
  * Put your running clothes out
  * Put your running shoes by the door
* Pair it with a current habit
  * Drink a coffee
  * Go read a running blog
  * Go run
* Make your competing distraction difficult
  * Hide your TV Remote and unplug the TV
  * Default your phone to a running a app

Starting small is important to build anticipation for the next session. Anticipation is a great motivator so leaving your sessions wanted more is a key.

In the steps you also see that making the things you want to do easy and the things you don't want to do hard is a main theme. Set up your environment to let you get you what you want to do on autopilot and avoid what you don't want to do. Environment cues are a very strong influencer on your actions so lay out your clothes to exercise and make what you're doing easy.

When first getting started it may not seem that your new habit is working. Exercising is making you more tired, studying is not yielding the results you're looking for. Atomic Habits uses the example of heat melting an ice cube, not change is apparent until you reach a critical threshold and you see a melt occur. Stick with what you're doing, all of a sudden you'll notice the results flowing in.

The habits we have also reflect our social sphere of influence. We are wired to stay with the herd. The people you are closest with will determine the attractiveness of your behaviors. So if you want to start bowling, hang out with other bowlers.

Lastly, give yourself a reward for being successful. A little X or checkmark goes a long way in recognizing your own efforts because your brain prioritizes short term rewards.

A few other books I would recommend to achieve the outcomes you are looking for:
* Your Brain at Work
* Influencer
* Power of Habit
