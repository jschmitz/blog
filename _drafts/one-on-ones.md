## Why
* This is the direct reports meeting. It is their time first.
* Build trust
* Build rapport
* Be able to talk about career & problems
* Fuzzy gray line when EAP becomes useful

## How - Scheduling
* Weekly is best
* People crave attention
* Be on time
* Be consistent, have a regular cadence
* Face to face is best... video for now

## How - In the meeting
BE PRESENT!!!!!

Assuming a 30 minute meeting
* The direct report always goes first.  10 minutes for what their topics are or however long it takes
* Short term manager time
* Long term talk about career and aspirations
* Be curious


## Tips
* Start with something positive
* Start with small talk
* End with something positive
* Ask open ended questions
* Be flexible on discussion topics (Its ok to have a great conversation that has little to do with work)

## Pitfalls
* Using as a status update meeting
*

## Good questions
* What is going well?
* Is there any work you're avoiding at the moment?
*
