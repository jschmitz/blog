My sister asked me the other day for a list of good business books.  I was surprised how quickly I arrived at my top 7 in a text message:
1. Atomic Habits
1. Getting to Yes
1. Influencer
1. Colin Powells Secrets of Leadership
1. Your Brain at Work
1. Grit
1. Effective Executive

I had to go back and think about why this list so quickly? I hadn't thought about it too much previously so how did this just roll out pretty quickly?


| Title   |      Author      |  Why I like it |
|----------|-------------|------|
| Atomic Habits |  James Clear | This is the foundatation. Habits drive outcomes. This book will help you start the habits you want, and need, to get to the outcomes you desirere. |
| Getting to Yes |    ?   |   This negoation book is not at all what I expected. Negoation is collaboration accomplished effectively. This may be #2 on my list but this may be where more of my focus will go. |
| Your Brain at Work | ?  |  Your Brain at Work is a fascinating read. Why do the tactics presented in the other books work? This one has the answers on why your brain resonds the way it does. |
| Influencer |  ?  | You don't want to row your boat in a circle and this book helps you to align to row the boat to a destination. |
| Influencer | Other  |    $1 |
|  Grit | Angela Duckworth  |  Grit + Atomic Habits  ==> Great outcomes.  |
|  Effective Exective | Peter Drucker  | Know thy time, only outcomes matter are good tidbits from Drucker to become and remain successful. |
| Colin Powell | ?  | The #1 concept I took away from this book is the importance of optimism and projecting optimism. Constructively crtical is necessary while maintaining a positive outlook. |

If you're getting into a leadership role naturally, getting started as a manager or these books have concepts that will help you. You'll need to practive applying the concepts that reasonate with you and fit them into your style. Many times you'll think, "Oh thats why that works" or see your collegues applying what you read about. Its fun seeing the forest from the trees and figuring out how some folks see to be so productive and influential.
