My sister asked me the other day for a list of good business books.  I was surprised how quickly I arrived at my top 7 in a text message:
1. [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=WnxhqnUsbm&rank=1)
1. [Getting to Yes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=tto1WeokIG&rank=1)
1. [Your Brain at Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6899290-your-brain-at-work?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=HbpYnwpsYf&rank=1)
1. [Grit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213329-grit?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=P1AGr8TdMf&rank=1)
1. [Colin Powells Secrets of Leadership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/416378.The_Leadership_Secrets_of_Colin_Powell?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=4NGN51ax9L&rank=1)
1. [Influencer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/914211.Influencer_)
1. [Effective Executive](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48019.The_Effective_Executive?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2bAB6he8ul&rank=1)

I had to go back and think about why this list so quickly? I hadn't thought about it too much previously so how did this just roll out pretty quickly?


These are the most impactful and useful books when I look back. I've take portions of each and worked to apply the concepts. Below is a brief description for each to see if you might want to check it out.

Title   |  Why I like it
----------|-------------
[Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=WnxhqnUsbm&rank=1) | This is the foundation. Habits drive outcomes. This book will help you start the habits you want, and need, to get to the outcomes you want.
[Getting to Yes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=tto1WeokIG&rank=1) | This negotiation book is not at all what I expected. Negotiation is great collaboration. Most people need to collaborate to be successful. This may be #2 on my list but this may be where more of my focus will go.
[Your Brain at Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6899290-your-brain-at-work?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=HbpYnwpsYf&rank=1) | Your Brain at Work is a fascinating read. Why do the tactics presented in the other books work? This one has the answers on why your brain responds the way it does.
[Grit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213329-grit?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=P1AGr8TdMf&rank=1) | Take your habits and apply long term perseverance and you have great combination. Questions regarding grit and perseverance are great for hiring and I particularly like the Hard Thing Rule.
[Colin Powells Secrets of Leadership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/416378.The_Leadership_Secrets_of_Colin_Powell?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=4NGN51ax9L&rank=1) | The #1 concept I took away from this book is the importance of optimism and projecting optimism. Constructively critical is necessary while maintaining a positive outlook.|
[Influencer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/914211.Influencer_) | Want to row your boat in one direction. Influencer can help you get there.
[Effective Executive](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48019.The_Effective_Executive?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2bAB6he8ul&rank=1) | Know thy time, get the right things done, only outcomes matter are good tidbits from Drucker to become and remain successful.

If you're getting into a leadership role naturally, getting started as a manager or these books have concepts that will help you. You'll need to practice applying the concepts that resonate with you and fit them into your style. Many times you'll think, "Oh thats why that works" or see your colleagues applying what you read about.
