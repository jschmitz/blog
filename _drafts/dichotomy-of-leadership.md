title: Dichotomy of Leadership
---
The pendulum is always swinging and its easy to let it get stuck in certain aspects of your leadership. [Dichotomy of Leadership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38714388-the-dichotomy-of-leadership) is all about finding balance for your leadership responsibilities and letting the pendulum have some motion. The pendulum swings empowing others, leading an following, mentoring and firing and so on.

This is a good read my notes are below and there was one highlight. Twice the authors touched on the importance of understanding the WHY.

# Chapter 1 - The ultimate dichotomy

* Balance between people and the orgs mission
    * Have to care about people
    * Have to train them
* Balance between leading and following
    * Let folks lead
    * Let them make decisions
    * Support and follow
    * Be at the stand by
* Balance providing negative information vs support
    * Need to provide negative feedback
    * Might cause conflict
    * Have tough conversations
* Business story
    * Regional manger trying to save jobs
    * Didn’t want to cut further despite being in the red
    * Had to cut further otherwise risked all jobs and risked being replace with someone that would over cut jobs

# Chapter 2 - Own it all but empower others
* As a leader you can swing between micro-managing and being too hands off
    * Story about running ops in to detailed and got too complicate to do everything
        * Ended up stunting growth of other team leads
        * Once giving up ownership leads grew, author was able to reach a higher level
    * Story about being too hands off and team getting sloppy
        * Had to stop the sloppiness
        * Directly confronted direct report lead
        * “Sloppy one more time and you’re out”
* Micromanaging symptoms
  * The team shows a lack of initiative. Members will not take action unless directed.
  * The team does not seek solutions to problems; instead its members sit and wait to be told about a solution.
  * Even in an emergency, a team that is being micro-managed will not mobilize and take action.
    * Bold and aggressive action becomes rare.
    * Creativity grinds to a halt.
    * The team tends to stay inside their own silos; not stepping out to coordinate efforts with other departments or divisions for fear of overstepping their bounds.
    * An overall sense of passivity and failure to react
    * ask
* Lassie Faire symptons
    * Lack of vision with team is trying to do and how to do it.
    * Lack of coordination between individuals on the team and efforts that often compete or interfere with each other.
    * Initiative oversteps the bounds of authority and both individuals and teams carry out actions that are beyond what they have the amortization to do.
    * Failure to coordinate. While a micromanaged team might not coordinate with other teams because it doesn’t want to overstep its bounds, a team without good guidance many also fail to coordinate not out of fear but out of ignorance. In its efforts to solve problems and accomplish the mission, the team forgets the other teams might also be maneuvering and end up interfering with their efforts.
    * The team is focused on the wrong priority mission or pursuit of solutions that are not in keeping with the strategic direction of the team or the commander’s intent.
    * There are too many people trying to lead. Since everyone is trying to lead there won’t be enough people to execute. Instead of progress, the leader will see discussion; instead of action, the leader will see prolonged debate; instead of unified movement, the leader will see fractured elements pursuing individual efforts.
* Business Story
    * CEO micromanaging
    * Got involved in the how and was making granular decisions
    * Dates slipping
    * Product not delivered
    * CEO had to step back

# Chapter 3 - Resolute but not overbearing
