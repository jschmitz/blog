The challenge of organizing teams in software projects can be a challenge when delivering software rapidly and the industry trend has been to deliver very frequently. There are numerous dynamics, both social and technical, that impact organization design of software companies. Team Topologies provides a model, patterns and anti-patterns to have conversations about how software delivery is organized. The team and flow diagrams are also excellent in the book and another great add to help facilitate conversations within your organization.

The Team Topology authors start by advocating for a team first approach to building software, a reverse Conways Law if you will. Conways law states that your architecture will be created to mimic the organizations existing communication patterns and by reversing the Conways law and thinking about your teams' communication flow before or when designing your architecture you will achieve great greater team flow and greater productivity.

Teams are the fundamental unit for delivering and when thinking about traits of a team effective traits would be:
* Small
* Stable
* Long lived

Teams develop their own internal dynamics are and, on slightly different topic, the most important aspect of employee engagement. Teams, team formation and team collaboration with adjacent teams are very important to deliver software and the day to productivity of individuals on those teams.

The authors propose four fundamental team topologies:
* Stream-aligned Team - continuous stream of work aligned to the business
* Enabling Team - specialist that increase the stream aligned teams capabilities through collaboration
* Complicated Sub System Team - Build and maintain a part of a system that requires specialized knowledge
* Platform Team - Enable stream aligned teams to deliver with substantial autonomy

A common, and perhaps legacy, approach to organizing teams is to organize based on specialization (UX, DBA, Data Processing, Operations, Architecture). The authors argue this will decrease flow as hand offs will increase (We know handoffs are bad from Spotify). The preferred approach would to create cross function teams with the skills necessary to deliver in a stream aligned flow. The greater the flow the more software being delivered.

The boundaries defined between teams helps to set expectations regarding communication and can be used to reduce cognitive load on a team.

Team Topologies is great read if you're thinking about how to structure your organization to increase your software delivery.  thinking about how your organization is structured
