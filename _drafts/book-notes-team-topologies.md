Chap 1
* Building systems is complex requiring interactions from multiple teams in a fast paced environment
* Organizations spend too much time on org charts and splitting work
* Org charts are not the actual communication flows
* Organizational Structures
  * Formal Structure - for compliance
  * Informal Structure - the realm of influence between people
  * Value Creation Structure - how work actually gets done based on inter personal and inter team reputation
* Conways Law
* Cognitive Load and Bottlenecks
  * Characteristics
    * Mixed and Matched activities
    * Hard to prioritize
    * Frequent Context Switching
  * Results
   * Lower Autonomy - diminished constant juggling
   * Lower Mastery - “jack of all trades, master of none”
   * Lower Purpose - too many domains of responsibility
* Obstacles to Fast Flow
  * Pushing against Conway’s Law
  * Software Too Big for Teams
  * Confusing Org Design Options
  * Team pulled in many directions
  * Painful Re-Org Every Few Years
  * Flow is blocked

Chap 2
* [Conways Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) - organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure.
* "If the architecture of the system and the architecture of the organization are odds the organization wins" - Ruth Malan
* Reverse Conway Maneuver - Organizations should evolve their team and architecture to achieve a desired architecture.
* A shared DBA team is likely to result in the emergence of a single shared database
* If we want our database to be per business domain we then we need to avoid having a single fan in database person or team (perhaps by adding the data capability into the application development team).
* Michal Nygard - "Team assignments are the first draft of architecture".
* The following architecture practices are helpful:
  * Loose Coupling - components do not hold strong dependencies on other components
  * High Cohesion - components have clearly bounded responsibilities and their internal elements are strongly related
  * Clear and appropriate version compatibility
  * Clear and appropriate cross team testing
* Organization design requires technical expertise
  * Technical people need to be involved in organization design
* Restrict unnecessary communication
* Everyone does not need to communicate with everyone
* Adherence to conways law can work against fast flow
  * Tool choices drive communication patterns
  * Many different component teams
  * Repeated reorganizations   that create fiefdoms or reduce headcount
