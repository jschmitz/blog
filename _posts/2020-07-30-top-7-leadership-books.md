My sister recently texted and asked for a list of good business books.  I was surprised how quickly I arrived at my top 7:
1. [Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=WnxhqnUsbm&rank=1)
1. [Getting to Yes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=tto1WeokIG&rank=1)
1. [Your Brain at Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6899290-your-brain-at-work?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=HbpYnwpsYf&rank=1)
1. [Grit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213329-grit?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=P1AGr8TdMf&rank=1)
1. [Colin Powells Secrets of Leadership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/416378.The_Leadership_Secrets_of_Colin_Powell?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=4NGN51ax9L&rank=1)
1. [Influencer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/914211.Influencer_)
1. [Effective Executive](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48019.The_Effective_Executive?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2bAB6he8ul&rank=1)

I had to go back and think about why these? I hadn't thought about it too much previously so how did this just roll out pretty quickly?

Upon a bit of reflection, these are the most impactful and useful books when I look back. I've take concepts from each, applied and have had positive outcomes. Below is a brief description for each to see if you might want to check it out.

Title   |  Why the read is impactful
----------|-------------
[Atomic Habits](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=WnxhqnUsbm&rank=1) | This is the foundation. Habits drive outcomes. This book will help you start the habits you want, and need, to get to the outcomes you want.
[Getting to Yes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/313605.Getting_to_Yes?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=tto1WeokIG&rank=1) | This negotiation book is not at all what I expected in a good way. Negotiation is great collaboration. Most people need to collaborate to be successful this read has approaches and tactics that are useful for you day to day. This may be #2 on my list but this may be where more of my focus will go.
[Your Brain at Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6899290-your-brain-at-work?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=HbpYnwpsYf&rank=1) | Your Brain at Work is a fascinating read. Why do the tactics presented in the other books work? This one has the answers on why your brain responds the way it does.
[Grit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27213329-grit?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=P1AGr8TdMf&rank=1) | Take your habits and apply long term perseverance and you have great combination. Questions regarding grit and perseverance are great for hiring and I particularly like the Hard Thing Rule.
[Colin Powells Secrets of Leadership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/416378.The_Leadership_Secrets_of_Colin_Powell?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=4NGN51ax9L&rank=1) | The #1 concept I took away from this book is the importance of optimism and projecting optimism. Constructively critical is necessary while maintaining a positive outlook.|
[Influencer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/914211.Influencer_) | Want to row your boat in one direction. Influencer can help you get there.
[Effective Executive](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48019.The_Effective_Executive?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2bAB6he8ul&rank=1) | Know thy time, get the right things done, only outcomes matter are good tidbits from Drucker to become and remain successful.

As you check start to check out some of these reads, it is a lot of fun to weave a new approaches into your day to day life and figure what will work for you. It's also fun to become aware of and identify successful approaches that and see if they may work for you too. These have helped me learn a bit more everyday, have little bit better conversations, keep improving results and having fun everyday. I hope a few these might have good impacts for you as well!
