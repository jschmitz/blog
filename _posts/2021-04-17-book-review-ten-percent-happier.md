title: "Improve focus and Sleep!"
---

My mind races. It seems to be racing all of the time and this seems helpful in many ways. The ability to think through problems, keep track of numerous different efforts and anticipate multiple upcoming scenarios seems to be helpful to arrive at good outcomes. On the flip side, there are two very apparent problems, and likely more, that my mind racing causes. First, waking up in the middle of the night is rough, my mind starts racing and getting back to sleep is a struggle and doesn’t always happen. Second, I'll struggle to focus and my mind wanders from present to an ongoing problem that I’m hashing through for the 18th time for no benefit.  Not great.

The deluge of Mindfulness advertising, apps and multiple folks around me touting mindfulness being helpful kept increasing my curiosity. One meeting a person shared, _"Headspace is da boooommb"._ That was enough for me to start checking it out a bit to see if it would be useful and I wanted to dig a bit deeper than what the app provided. I wouldn’t say I’m exactly a skeptic, but jumping all the way to the work of someone totally zen seemed a bit too much for me. I encountered the [Dan Harris book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18505796-10-happier) on several lists, with good ratings. After some initial skepticism I decided to give it a read and found the read to be a great fit for an entry level person.

The premise of the book is that you can become 10% Happier by engaging in a consistent meditation practice. That premise fits in my frame of mind; doing a _thing_ consistently will result in compounding returns. Good start. A secondary theme is that mindfulness does not need to result in you losing your edge, on the contrary, it can help to improve your focus and your outcomes. Like that too.

The read detailed the journey of the author through some rough problems, my two issues are very mundane in comparison, and mindful discoveries are presented story by story. I was previously familiar with Dan Harris as a broadcaster and the high profile supporting cast of TV News personalities and the industry also helps to keep the stories engaging. The read seems to loosely operate with cycles of _mindfulness thing_ is total malarky, something intriguing about kind of fit, deeper exploration reveals that _mindfulness thing_ is pretty useful. The vivid language and humor really works for this type of storytelling.

A few things stood out for me:
* A small amount of time each day may go a long way
* “Is this useful?” - ask that after the 17th time I’ve gone over my schedule for the day
* Respond over react - Instead of reacting to bad stimuli; label your reaction and then respond in a constructive manner
* RAIN
  * Recognize
  * Allow
  * Investigate
  * Nurture
* You can only do one thing at a time (seems like a bonus addition!)

These concepts fit in nicely with two other reads I have found very useful [Atomic Habits]() and [Your Brain at Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6899290-your-brain-at-work?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=A9AQhA7QpL&rank=1).

Regarding your Brain at Work, labeling was discussed thoroughly and mindfulness seems to be a practical means to help you to pause and label your emotions, which in turn will help to limit your fight or flight response and that may result in a better outcome. Cool stuff.


This was a great read for my current level of understanding.  The author has helped me to start up a habit of meditation and we’ll see if it can result in more consistent engagement and better sleep!
