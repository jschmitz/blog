Hello! Thank you for the visit to the first post of the blog! The primary focus of this blog will be to share knowledge about:
1. Software Engineering
1. Leadership
1. Health

Outside of family time, my time, energy and learning go into those three topics.

I'm optimistic a bit of content will be created that a few folks will find useful.
I also have a bit of trepediation about writing publicly, its new for me and I have a suspicion I'll write about getting better at writring. Very meta.

My plan for writing improvement is two fold. First, write often. A theme I see in learning is that you'll learn faster if you do the thing and do that thing your learning a lot. Avoid analysis paralysis.  Perhaps a more in depth post on that topic at a later date.
Second, study the topic. As I find good resources I'll post!

With that, lets get started!
