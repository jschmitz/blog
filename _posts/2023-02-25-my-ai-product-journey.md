# My Product Journey Using AI

How doomed are software developers concerning AI?

Not that doomed from what I know today, and I'm excited to check out how the tools can help save time. The following series of posts will be to describe that journey.

I've concocted a project to see how much of a product I can build using AI. The goal will be to use AI as much as possible. It will be wild.

Like any good developer, I've purchased the domain for tracktosleep.com to get started on a Track to Sleep app. The app will be a habit tracker that ties into your nightly sleep results.

With that, to AI to attempt to write the remainder of the post, ChatGPT is functional, so I should be good to go...

So far, I've asked:

- id like to write a series of blog posts to build a product using AI. the app will be called "Track to Sleep". Can you write the first blog post
- i want to use AI to build the product but AI will not be in the product. Can you blog about the development experience using AI to build track to sleep
- this will be the first of many posts and "Track to Sleep" will also collection information about daily habits that influence sleep.
- can you write a blog post about using AI to build track to sleep as if is the first step in a long journey? and add how using chatgpt was used initially?
- can you add an introduction that will indicates this will be a series of blog posts
- can you write the blog post and target a software developer audience

The responses were... Wow! ChatGPT excited me to build this app, and the amount of work it created exploded! The responses are great advertisements for the app, and I'm ready to download and use this! The creator needs to get moving faster.

With that, I'm not asking questions that will yield the result(s) that I'm expecting for the responses to finish this post. The prose returned is compelling, but I need to emphasize the AI usage to build vs. AI in the product. What I'm looking for is a bit nuanced, so interesting initial interaction.

My conclusion from my initial attempt to get AI to save me time is that there will be a level of skill involved with formulating questions and interactions that I'll need to develop along the way. I was not anticipating a free ride and did not arrive at a result I would copy and paste.

You can see all of the [interactions here](first-blog-post-chatgpt-full.md)
, and I've added the closest response I was looking for below. Next, I'd like to write a pitch for the product to guide me.

can you write a blog post about using AI to build track to sleep as if is the first step in a long journey? and add how using chatgpt was used initially?

Sure, I can definitely write a blog post about using AI to build Track to Sleep as the first step in a long journey, and how ChatGPT was used initially. Here's a possible blog post:

Title: Using AI to Build Track to Sleep: The First Step in a Long Journey

When we set out to build Track to Sleep, our goal was to create a revolutionary sleep tracking app that leveraged AI technology to provide personalized recommendations and insights. But building such a complex app is no easy feat, and we knew that we would need all the help we could get.

That's where ChatGPT came in. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, ChatGPT is an incredibly powerful tool that can help developers quickly generate text for a wide range of applications. And we knew that it would be an invaluable asset as we began our journey to build Track to Sleep.

Using ChatGPT, we were able to quickly generate text for everything from user interface elements to error messages to help documentation. This saved us countless hours of writing and editing, allowing us to focus on the more challenging aspects of building the app.

But ChatGPT was just the beginning. As we began to develop the app in earnest, we quickly realized that we would need to leverage a wide range of AI techniques to make Track to Sleep a reality. Here are just a few of the ways that we used AI to build the app:

Data collection: To train our predictive models and generate personalized recommendations, we needed to collect large amounts of data about users' sleep patterns and daily habits. We used AI techniques like data scraping and natural language processing to collect and analyze this data, ensuring that our models were as accurate and effective as possible.

Predictive modeling: To accurately classify different stages of sleep and identify patterns of sleep disturbances, we used a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to build predictive models that were able to analyze complex patterns in sleep data.

Personalization: To provide personalized recommendations and insights, we used AI techniques like clustering and decision trees to create a personalized sleep profile for each user, taking into account factors like sleep patterns, daily habits, and other personal data.

By leveraging these and other AI techniques, we were able to build Track to Sleep into a powerful and comprehensive sleep tracking app that can help users improve their sleep habits and achieve better overall health and wellness.

Of course, building an app like Track to Sleep is just the first step in a long journey. As we continue to develop and refine the app, we're constantly exploring new AI techniques and technologies that can help us improve the user experience and provide even more personalized recommendations and insights.

So if you're ready to start your own journey to better sleep, download Track to Sleep today and see how AI technology can help you achieve your goals. And stay tuned for our next blog post, where we'll dive deeper into how Track to Sleep uses predictive modeling to analyze your sleep patterns and provide personalized recommendations.
