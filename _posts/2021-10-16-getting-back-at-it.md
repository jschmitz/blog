The summer and early fall were a good time to take a break from the screen, enjoy the outdoors. family time and re-energize. After a year of covid, getting outdoors to socialize was especially nice.  As we’re moving into the fall and winter months it’s a good time to spend a bit of extra time at the keyboard and get into a good learn, review, and share cycle. I’m excited to get started again! 

The summer also provided a good time to think about purpose.  What to write about? What to add to the website, what to learn about? I’ve worked on the personal site in HTML CSS, Elixir, and Rails.  Thinking a bit of a deep dive into the JavaScript world would be fun. If I can work on a few [FreeClimb](https://www.freeclimb.com/) features that would be great. I spend a bunch of time struggling, in a good way, to invest time in multiple interests, and sharing what works will be a good topic too.

With all those fun topics I’m excited to get back at it.
