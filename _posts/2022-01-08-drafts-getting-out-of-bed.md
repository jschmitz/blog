The first act of the day, the mental battle to defeat the snooze, defeat falling back asleep, and defeat your internal negotiation with yourself to get out of bed. The struggle to start moving. Getting your two feet onto the floor at a consistent time gets your day going as you planned. 

Consistently winning this battle to build a habit takes effort, time, and experimentation with what works for you. Short-circuiting sleep is a bad option; get those zzzs. Outside of shortening your sleep, there is plenty to experiment with! You can vary your purpose, your alarm(s), the time you wake up, and social influences. There's not a one-size-fits-all approach, and the discussion on these areas might help you get going!

## Your Purpose
The reason you're getting up is a big deal. It would help if you had the excitement to get those feet out of bed. It will be too easy to negotiate back to sleep if you’re not fired up about what you’re doing.

You can experiment with your routine to ensure the thing you're jazzed about is your main thing. Exercise, blog, code, or read a book. There might be one that gets you going the most. Do that first, and then stack your next activity from there. An exception to consider, even if exercise isn't the most exciting item on the menu for you,  a Neural Morning Primer (NMP) may be helpful to get going. Stack the NMP with your main activity, and you have a flow you don't need to think about, or negotiate with yourself, to start your day. 

## Be Stealth - Quiet Alarms
Let's be honest, not everyone you live with wants to be up early in the AM with you, and part of the draw to get up early is that other folks aren't up with you. It's your time. The ability to get going quietly can be a make or break for your motivation to get up in the morning, and if your alarm on the other side of the room loudly going off wakes up your partner, kids, or roommates, that approach is not going to work in the long run. 

You can be get up while others keep sleeping, and here are a few tips for how to be stealth:

### Wrist Alarm
A wrist alarm works well with a vibration option. You can find inexpensive options for around $20; the downside is that the user experience is rough. You will spend time figuring out what buttons to hold down and click a lot, but they will get the job done. For 20 times the price, the Apple Watch is easier to use, and the wrist vibration is more subtle.

You can experiment with setting multiple alarms to get going, its a bit of a mini snooze, but in the long run.... meh. It would be worth trying if it helps to get started and keep moving towards less snoozing. The end goal would be to get out of bed immediately with one alarm. You are getting lousy sleep on those snoozes, which doesn't help you and the extra jostling around multiple times reduces stealth for others. A better combination might be to light up your morning!

### Light Alarm
A light alarm and wrist vibration provide for a good combination. The combination of the two is a good reminder that you want to get out of bed. You can experiment with the light slowly waking you up and then the wrist alarm triggering at a specific time and figure out what works for you. There is a wide range of options that can light up your morning. The inexpensive versions have the same usability challenges, but they get the job done to light up your morning, like the inexpensive silent wrist alarms.

### Find Your Time
Another area to experiment with is the time you wake up. At one point, I found 6 am too late to get up with any alarm. I'd wake everyone else in the house, most notably the kids, and that would be frustrating not being able to do what I was expecting to do. The 5:30 wake-up was hit or miss waking folks up, and at 5 am, everyone would keep sleeping. With those constraints, it ended up being 5 am or bust. Fast forward a couple of years, and being stealthy for the kids will be a thing of the past (I might need to return the favor of the unwanted early wake-ups :-) ).

## Your Circle
The folks in your area might keep sleeping, but others might help keep you accountable. A team activity, neighborhood workout, or building a following on a social network can help create a morning habit and influence yourself to keep it going. A good example is [Jocko's morning watch](https://www.instagram.com/jockowillink/). There are numerous options available that range from gym classes to posting pictures of pages read in a book.

## Summary
The seemingly simple act of getting out of bed has numerous experimentation vectors that can help you find your way to a successful morning routine. Your morning and nighttime routines are connected, and that nighttime routine is key to being successful in the morning. Experimenting and finding what works for is fun and rewarding as you find what works best for you and your current set of habits and aspirations. 

After many iterations, my current morning jam is a challenging functional workout, simultaneous wrist plus light alarm at 5 am. I plan to experiment with the light alarm for a more gradual wake-up. Socializing is another area of experimentation, and this post has helped me with my social influence. The current setup helps get me energized for a good day, and I'll keep making tweaks to keep making it better. 

The experiments you try at the start of your day can help get you off to a great start!
